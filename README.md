> Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:
> 
> ```bash
> npm run dev
> 
> # or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
> npm run dev -- --open
> ```
> 
> ## Building
> 
> To create a production version of your app:
> 
> ```bash
> npm run build
> ```
> 
> You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
> 
> > To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
